`settings` has Emacs setting files(.el) for developers.
Furthermore, there are useful settings(cygwin, vim, XChat, Xcode and fonts on Linux and OSX).
In fact, `settings` is most personal.
If you need them, use them freely.
Give me feedback if you have any problems or issues.

Quick setup
===========
* Download `settings` in your home directory.

```sh
~$ git clone git://github.com/jglee1027/settings.git
```

* run `install-settings`

```sh
~$ cd ~/settings
~/settings$ ./install-settings
```
